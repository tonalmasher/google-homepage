### This is my attempt at re-creating a webpage.
- I am following the Web Development track on the Odin Project.
- I'm  interested in this track as it is using Git and github to publish changes, which is something I'm completely unfamiliar with.
- I also hope to increase my knowledge of html and css during this time.
